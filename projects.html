    <h5><i>Projects reflect the knowledge and capabilities of a person and <br>my capabilities are shown by the following projects.</i></h5>
    
    <div class="games">
    <img class="game_logo" src="images/games.png" alt="Games Logo">
    <ul>
    <li><h2>GAMES:</h2></li>
    <li><h3><i>In the course of this pandemic and online classes, I borrowed some time to invest in my coding skills. I developed a few cassic games like Ping Pong, Tic-Tac-Toe, Sprint Racers, Turtle Drawer, Snakes and Alien Invasion. This games have become a nice mind freshers for me.</i></h3></li>
    </ul></div>

    <div class="hand">
    <img class="hand_logo" src="images/hand.png" alt="Hand Logo">
    <ul>
    <li><h2>Handwirtten Digit Detection:</h2></li>
    <li><h3><i>Well making games cannot be enough, from this I used the knowledge of Machine Learning to develop a model which was able to identify handwritten digits. It helped me to expand my knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</h3></li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mask">
    <img class="mask_logo" src="images/mask.png" alt="Masked Man Logo">
    <ul>
    <li><h2>Masked Detection Software:</h2></li>
    <li><h3><i>After my first software, I was attracted towards Artificial Intelligence. AI knowledge helped me to develop a Face Mask Detection Software which used the webcam to capture live footages and detect the presence of mask on a human face.</i>></h3></li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="iot">
    <img class="iot_logo" src="images/iot.png" alt="IOT Logo">
    <ul>
    <li><h2>Database System:</h2></li>
    <li><h3><i>As my academics were also making me inspired. Thus, an IOT based software was what I developed. Improving my previous Face Mask Detection Software, I developed a software which on the absence of a face mask clicked a photo and saved it in a Database for future references. This has become a prime gem in my developed softwares list.</i></h3></li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="security">
    <img class="security_logo" src="images/security.png" alt="Security Logo">
    <ul>
    <li><h2>Advance Security System:</h2></li>
    <li><h3><i>Last but not the least I would like to mention my Self-Developed Security System with Pyhton which uses voice inputted password and face detection to determine authorized users. This helped me in my academics as well as in my coding practices.</i></h3></li>
